# A Full-Fledged Network Setup of an Organization with Multiple Subnets

This is simulation based project where a whole university network system is connected using multiple subnets. Here different 
wired and wireless connections had been established. There are a server room in the 
infrastructure where DHCP server provides IP to each end devices, WEB server contains the 
webpage elements in an IP address and DNS converts the requested domain name into IP 
address. In this infrastructure, more end devices can be used in the future and no more 
configuration is needed for that.
So, using this network system. the university can run a number of complex networked systems 
to support several of its business process like admissions, advising, results, e-Tender, library 
management, accounts and so on.

**Special Features :**
1. The network addresses forms all the 3 classes.
2. Single DHCP server controls IP over multiple subnets.
3. Different Subnets are incorporated to each other.

**Software Used :** Cisco Packet Tracer
**Language Used :** Command Line Interface (CLI) for Device Configuration

Here is the Network Design :
